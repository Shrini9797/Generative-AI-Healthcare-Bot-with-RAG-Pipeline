## Multimodal RAG Application for Healthcare
### Overview
This project showcases a cutting-edge Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application tailored for medical use cases. By integrating GPT-4V with an embedding model and a vector database, the application offers precise, context-aware responses to user queries, including relevant images extracted from PDF documents.

### Features
Multimodal Capabilities: Combines text and visual data for comprehensive query responses.
Advanced AI Integration: Utilizes GPT-4V for generating detailed and accurate responses.
Efficient Backend: Built with FastAPI for high-performance API handling.
Document Processing: Leverages the unstructured library to process tables and images within PDFs.
Healthcare Focused: Designed specifically for medical use cases, enhancing data retrieval and user interaction.

### Technology Stack
GPT-4V: Versatile large language model for generating responses.
FastAPI: Modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python.
Vector Database: Ensures efficient data retrieval and management.
Unstructured Library: Handles diverse data types such as tables and images in PDF documents.
